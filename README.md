# About

A Don't Break the Chain Calendar. It feeds upon user's activity on github.

## Stories

* I want to see the calendar, so that I can check on the progress so far.

## Implementation
* The calendar should be web-based and hosted on github.
* Days with github activity should be marked.

## Tasks
* create a hosted site for this OK
* identify current github user
* clonned repo should identify the new user
* query user github activity OK
* map user activity on calendar days
* prettify the calendar view

## Open Issues
* Is there a github api v3 javascript impl?
* Which is the easiest way to publish on gh-pages? Please see scala_school and JavaScript-Garden.
